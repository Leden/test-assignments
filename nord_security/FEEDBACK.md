Pros:
1. The overall task was done very well
2. All of the task requirements were completed without major issues
3. Good documentation (plus on extra comments about implementation)
4. Nice overall code style and addition of error checks
5. multistage docker image build (not often seen in tasks)
6. usage of async framework

Some cons:
1. Lack of well-rounded project structure (this may be due to open ended nature of the task)
2. No tests
3. More production ready code examples
