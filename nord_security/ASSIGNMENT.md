## Task 1 – Development
Write a small WeatherAPI application using Python and a web framework you like or have
experience with. You can get weather forecasts from weatherapi.com or any other weather
information service you can find.
Requirements:
1. Routes should be protected using JWT authentication
2. The application receives weather data from a third-party service
3. The application should be able to return a weather forecast for a given city or country

## Task 2 – Containerization
Containerize your Python web application using Docker. Write a Dockerfile that will be used to
build an image of your application.
Requirements:
1. Use Gunicorn as a Python WSGI HTTP Server

## Task 3 – Deployment
After containerizing and building your application in Docker, write deployment manifests for
Kubernetes.
Requirements:
1. Deployment should work on standard development environments like MiniKube, Kind,
etc.

## Task 4 – Documentation
Document the application you just created. Describe the possible issues and improvements you
could fix or make. Write a simple instruction on how to test your application.

## Remarks
● If you get stuck, ask for help/hints.
● Any questions? Ask.
● Don’t want to register on weatherapi.com to get an API key? Send us a message and we
will provide one for you!

## Results
Set up a GIT repository with your code and documentation or just archive all of it and send it to
us.
